## Concept

This repo contains the second Project my team and I developed for the Wild Code School.
My 3 partners for this project were Yannick Boudjelal (https://github.com/Bouman), Laurent Duclos (https://github.com/ldc911) and Russen Bissemo (https://github.com/russenbissemo).

The project had to be done in 5 weeks with no Back-end and the use of at least one API.
We chose to develop the project with React JS and CSS Vanilla.
For the API we used the League of Legends API DATA DRAGON to get info about the game champions.

The main feature of the application is a card game inspired from Slay the Spire in the League of Legends universe.
